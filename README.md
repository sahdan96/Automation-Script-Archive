# Automation-Script-Archive
A centralized repository for storing automation scripts and registry files. This repository serves as a single source of truth for all the scripts used to automate various tasks and processes, along with their corresponding registry files. All scripts and registry files are well-organized, versioned, and maintained for quick reference and use.

## Please take note
Modifying the registry can be a risky operation, as incorrect changes can result in system instability or even prevent the operating system from booting. Before making any modifications to the registry, it is important to backup the registry, understand the implications of the changes, and test the modifications in a controlled environment. Modifications should only be made by experienced users or administrators who fully understand the risks involved.
